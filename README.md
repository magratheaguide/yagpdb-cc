# YAGPDB Custom Commands

## What is this?

The [YAGPDB Discord bot](yagpdb.xyz/) allows you to add custom functionality to the bot via "custom commands." What you'll find here is a set of custom commands meant to support RP sites' specific needs.

If you have an idea for changes, updates, or even a new set of custom commands entirely that you'd like to share with the community, please know that **pull requests are welcome**!

## Why YAGPDB?

I've personally found YAGPDB's custom command structure more comprehensive and capable than alternatives like Carl-bot and Atlas (both of which I tried to use for the Question and Answer tooling before discovering YAGPDB).

YAGPDB can also [create self-assignable roles](https://docs.yagpdb.xyz/tools-and-utilities/self-assignable-roles), which I've found extremely helpful for enabling members to designate their own pronouns and time zones within Discord.

## What's included?

- *Question and Answer*: Creates a queue of unanswered member questions and tracks progress on these to help keep admins from missing any member questions. Can automatically send questions to the queue or answers to a designated FAQ channel using staff-limited reactions to messages.
- *Utilities*: Supporting custom commands

For a demo, please contact Daine on Discord (daine#1078).
